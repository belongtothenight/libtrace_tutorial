3. wandio
4. libtrace
5. libtrace tutorial (forked, original can't be compiled)

You will be able to select different parts of the options listed in [./config.ini](./config.ini) file to install/re-install or remove after initial run is completed.

## Installation

To use this script, clone this repository, navigate to this directory, and run the setup script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ylai/libtrace_tutorial.git
cd libtrace_tutorial/setup
bash ./setup.sh
```

If you want to make sure things are running correctly, you can check the [Demo](#demo) section for the video links and log files, and [Debug](#debug) section for common issues and solutions.

In default settings, everything including this repo will be installed in `/opt` directory. If you want to change the installation directory, please modify the [./config.ini](./config.ini) file.

## Tested Platforms

1. WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
2. VM Ubuntu 23.10

    ```bash
    while true; do sleep 1; clear; echo -e "/usr/local/include"; ls /usr/local/include; echo -e "\n/usr/local/lib"; ls /usr/local/lib; echo -e "\n/opt"; ls /opt; done
    ```
- Install or Re-install: (change [./config.ini](./config.ini) before running)
    ```bash
    bash ./setup.sh
    ```
- Remove: (change [./config.ini](./config.ini) before running)
    ```bash

## Debug

- wget and curl can't resolve host in WSL2 environment
    1. Edit `/etc/resolv.conf` as following:
        ```bash
        # This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/wsl.conf:
        # [network]
        # generateResolvConf = false
        nameserver 1.1.1.1
        ```
    2. Optional, edit `/etc/wsl.conf` to contain following network section:
        ```bash
        [network]
        generateResolveConf = false
        ```
- message similar to `error while loading shared libraries: libtrace.so.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`:<br>
    Execute the command below and try again:
    ```bash
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib"
    ```
- repo existed, symlink existed causing unable to create symlink error:<br>
    Try to remove installation and try again:
    ```bash
    bash ./remove.sh
    bash ./setup.sh
    ```
- C code related compiling warning/error:<br>
    First fix the error, adjust [./config.ini](./config.ini) to only run the error section, then try to partially re-compile:
    ```bash
    bash ./setup.sh
    ```
    or partially remove and re-install/compile:
    ```bash
    bash ./remove.sh
    bash ./setup.sh
    ```
